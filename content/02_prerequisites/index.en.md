Please choose whether you are running this workshop in your own AWS account, or in EventEngine at an AWS event.

::alert[Note that Event Engine does not support the use of AWS Marketplace at the time this lab was created. As a result, parts which involve using the AWS Marketplace, such as running the Fortinet or Palo Alto labs, have to be done in your own AWS account. The Open Source parts, including the Suricata lab can be completed within an Event Engine AWS Account.]{type="warning"}

::alert[Please ensure you have already created a Key Pair within your environment, if not, then please follow the instructions from this [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/create-key-pairs.html).]{type="warning"}
