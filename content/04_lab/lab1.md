8. Wait for the CloudFormation stack to complete. This may take a few minutes.
9. Navigate back to the Valtix Controller tab. You should still be on the onboarding page where you clicked on CloudFormation template link.

## Verification

1. Navigate to **Discovery -> Inventory -> Summary**. This page provides a list of cloud resources that was discovered by Valtix. On one page, we see everything in your account. 
2. Now generate traffic to see DNS and VPC information:

      1.  SSH to the EC2 instance created in the spoke1-vpc. Default user is centos. (eg. `ssh -i <private_key.pem> centos@<ec2_eip>`)
      1.  Generate traffic to following website:


    ```
    curl http://www.google.com
    curl http://www.facebook.com
    curl -o /dev/null -silient http://purplehoodie.com
    sudo yum -y update &
    ```
    
4. Navigate to **Discovery -> Traffic -> DNS**.
5. This provides a summary of the traffic that Valtix gathered from DNS query logs. 
6. Click on **Logs**. You should see the traffic that you generated to Google and Facebook.

7. Click on **Malicious Categories**. If Valtix detects traffic that could potentially be malicious, Valtix highlights those sessions for users. Navigate back to Summary. This provides a better view to see malicious activities.
8. The traffic generated to purplehoodie is a potential malicious site categorized by brightcloud. If you lookup purlehoodie.com in [brightcloud url-lookup](https://www.brightcloud.com/tools/url-ip-lookup.php), you'll realize that it's high risk.
9. Navigate to **Discovery -> Traffic -> VPC.**
10. Through VPC flow logs, Valtix provides a summary on VPC traffic and where it is connecting to.
