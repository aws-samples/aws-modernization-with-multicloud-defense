Multicloud Defense provides network visibility and control of your public cloud deployments to protect them for a variety of scenarios: ingress, egress, and east-west. Managing cloud infrastructure is a nightmare as cloud deployments happen at the touch of a button. Security maintenance of patching and upgrading software may disrupt the network service, resulting in countless hours of troubleshooting. Valtix sees the pain and hence provides users with:

- **Visibility:** A detailed view of the inventory and traffic in the network
- **Speed:** deploy security in minutes
- **Dyanmic Policies:** policies that are still effective even as resource changes.
