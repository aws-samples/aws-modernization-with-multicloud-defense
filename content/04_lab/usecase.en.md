Valtix provides network visibility and control of your public cloud deployments to protect them for a variety of scenarios: ingress, egress, and east-west. Managing cloud infrastructure is a nightmare as cloud deployments happen at the touch of a button. Security maintenance of patching and upgrading software may disrupt the network service, resulting in countless hours of troubleshooting. Valtix sees the pain and hence provides users with:

- <b>Visibility:</b> A detailed view of the inventory and traffic in the network
- <b>Speed:</b> deploy security in minutes
- <b>Dyanmic Policies:</b> policies that are still effective even as resource changes.

This workshop will focus on egress and east-west case. For details on ingress case, please visit [Valtix Tutorial page](https://docs.valtix.com)
